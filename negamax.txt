The negamax function is an implementation of the Negamax algorithm, commonly used for AI in two-player games like tic-tac-toe. Hereâ€™s what it does:

Parameters:

b: current board state
player: current player symbol
opp: opponent symbol
a, beta: alpha-beta pruning bounds
depth: recursion depth
Checks for a winner:

If the game is over, returns a score based on who won and how deep in the recursion (earlier wins are better).
Searches all possible moves:

For each empty cell, simulates the move for the current player.
Recursively calls itself, swapping player and opponent, and inverting the score.
Uses alpha-beta pruning to skip unnecessary branches.
Returns the best score found for the current player.

This function helps the AI choose the optimal move by evaluating all possible outcomes.
